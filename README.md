# Ruby NLP

This repository is a pure Ruby toolkit for NLP. It's the examples part of an ongoing series I'm writing on [SitePoint.com](http://sitepoint.com), so watch this repository for updates!

## Installing

Simply install the gem:

```sh
gem install ruby_nlp
```

## What's In This Project?

### *n*-grams

A simple class to generate *n*-grams from an input string, either per word, per character, or on some custom splitter.

```ruby
require 'ruby_nlp/ngram'
ngram = Ngram.new("foo bar lux win")

ngram.unigrams # => [["foo"], ["bar"], ["lux"], ["win"]]
ngram.bigrams # => [["foo", "bar"], ["bar", "lux"], ["lux", "win"]]
ngram.trigrams # => [["foo", "bar", "lux"], ["bar", "lux", "win"]]
ngram.ngrams(4) # => [["foo", "bar", "lux", "win"]]

ngram = Ngram.new("abcde", regex: //)
ngram.unigrams # => [["a"], ["b"], ["c"], ["d"], ["e"]]
```

### Corpus Extractor

There is a basic corpus loader. It takes a glob for the files that are part of the corpus, and a class to delegate the sentence extraction to.

Currently, support for the following corpus types are included:

* Brown Corpus, in the `BrownCorpusFile` class at `ruby_nlp/corpus_files/brown`. This corpus currently strips the tagging to reveal only the raw sentences in the corpus.

An example of this in action:

```ruby
require 'ruby_nlp/corpus'
require 'ruby_nlp/corpus_files/brown'

corpus = Corpus.new('brown/c*', BrownCorpusFile)
corpus.trigrams # => One *really* big array of trigrams!

corpus.files # => `Array` of `BrownCorpusFile` instances, one for each file found.
corpus.sentences # => Flattened `Array` of sentences.
```

## Examples

Some examples are in the `examples` directory, one per article from [SitePoint.com](http://sitepoint.com) in this series.

## Future Work

* Support for other corpora.
* Preservation, filtering and searching of tags in corpora.
* Markov modelling and chaining.
* Text generation using Markov modelling.
* Part of speech tagging.
* Classification.
